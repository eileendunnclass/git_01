## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

A boat beneath a sunny sky,  
Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July —  

Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,  
Pleased a simple tale to hear —  

Long has paled that sunny sky:  
Echoes fade and memories die:  
Autumn frosts have slain July.  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

I have been one acquainted with the night.  
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.  
I have outwalked the furthest city light.  

I have looked down the saddest city lane.  
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,  
      Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
      The billows smooth and bright —  
And this was odd, because it was  
      The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
      Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
      After the day was done —  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->


Beneath the sky, a story starts anew,  
A boy and girl with hearts sincere and true.  
In a meadow where the wildflowers bloom,  
They met one day, dispelling all their gloom.  

His eyes, a shade of summer's deepest blue,  
Her smile, a sunrise breaking through the dew.  
Their paths converged as if by fate's design,  
Two souls entwined, their futures to align.  

From nervous greetings, blossoms friendship's charm,  
Their laughter echoed, free from fear or harm.  
Through whispered secrets, dreams began to weave,  
A tapestry of love they'd soon believe.  

Hand in hand, they wandered through the days,  
Each moment cherished, love in every gaze.  
From first hello to vows they soon would share,  
A journey filled with tenderness and care.  

The boy, now groom, with joy upon his face,  
The girl, his bride, in white and satin lace.  
Beneath an arch of roses, they now stand,  
With rings to bind, and love to hold their hand
